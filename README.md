# JetpackCompose Playground
This is my playground for JetPack Compose.

Jetpack Compose uses a custom Kotlin compiler plugin to transform these composable functions into the app's UI elements.
Composable functions can only be called from within the scope of other composable functions. To make a function composable, add the @Composable annotation.

This code sample covers:
* Defining composable functions
* Using and styling columns to improve layout
* Styling your app with the Material Design principles
